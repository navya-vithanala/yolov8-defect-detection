# YOLOv8 Defect Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project implemented a **real-time defect detection system** for industrial pipelines using **YOLOv8**. The system reached **92% precision** on 1,200 samples.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python, PyTorch, OpenCV
- GPU acceleration with CUDA
- YOLOv8 model from Ultralytics

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Image dataset collection and annotation
2. Preprocessing (normalization, augmentation)
3. YOLOv8 training with industrial defect dataset
4. Real-time inference pipeline via OpenCV

## 📊 Results
- **92% precision** on validation dataset
- Inference speed ~25 FPS on GPU
- Transferable to new defect types with minimal retraining

## 🌟 Applications
- Quality control in manufacturing
- Real-time monitoring systems
