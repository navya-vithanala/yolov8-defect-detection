# YOLOv8 Defect Detection
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Overview
Designed and deployed a real-time defect detection system that achieved **92% precision** on 1,200 samples. Built using PyTorch and OpenCV for industrial-grade vision pipelines.  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- PyTorch, OpenCV  
- YOLOv8  

## Features
- Real-time defect detection in images/videos  
- High precision with optimized model training  
- Augmentation and validation to reduce overfitting  

## Results
- 92% precision on dataset of 1,200 samples  
- Deployment-ready inference pipeline
